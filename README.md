> Build hydrogens from a united-atom MD of lipids and calculate the order parameter.

## Features

BuildH can :
  - reconstruct hydrogens from a **united-atom** structure file (PDB, GRO) or a trajectory.
  - calculate the order parameter based on the reconstructed hydrogens
  - write a new structure/trajectory file with the reconstructed hydrogens


BuildH works in two modes :
  1.  A slow mode when an output trajectory (e.g. in xtc format) is requested by
     the user. In this case, the whole trajectory including newly built
     hydrogens are written to this trajectory.
  2. A fast mode without any output trajectory.


## Requirements

Python >= 3.6 is mandatory for running buildH.

buildH is written in Python 3 and needs the modules numpy, pandas and MDAnalysis.

## Installation 

### Simple installation

A simple installation with pip will do the trick:

```
pip install buildh
```

All dependencies (modules) will be installed automatically by pip.

### Installation within a conda environment

In case you want to install buildH within a [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html), first create a new conda env:

```
conda create -n env_buildH python pip
```

Then activate your environment:

```
conda activate env_buildH
```

Last, install buildH within that environment using `pip`:

```
pip install buildh
```

*Note*: we recall that once the conda env is activated, when you use `pip` it is the version of `pip` within the conda env, not the one of your Unix system. It allows to embed buildH and all its dependencies within the env without interacting with the Python of the Unix system.

For installing a developement version, see [here](https://github.com/patrickfuchs/buildH/blob/master/devtools/install_dev.md).

## Launching buildH

Once installed with `pip` as shown above, a simple invocation of `buildH` will launch the program (`$` represents the Unix prompt):

```
$ buildH
usage: buildH [-h] -c COORD [-t TRAJ] -l LIPID [-lt LIPID_TOPOLOGY [LIPID_TOPOLOGY ...]] -d DEFOP
              [-opx OPDBXTC] [-o OUT] [-b BEGIN] [-e END] [-pi PICKLE]
buildH: error: the following arguments are required: -c/--coord, -l/--lipid, -d/--defop
```

Some more documentation on the meaning of the different flags can be found on the [documentation page](https://buildh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) or by using the `-h` flag.
